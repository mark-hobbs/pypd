# Bonds, BondArray, or BondSet?
class BondSet:
    """
    The main class for storing the bond set.

    Attributes
    ----------
    bondlist : ndarray (int)
        Array of pairwise interactions (bond list)

    nlist : ndarray (int)
        TODO: define a new name and description
        TODO: ndarray or list of numpy arrays?

    material: ndarray (int)
        Array defining the material type of every bond
        TODO: name - bonds.material or bonds.type?

    c : ndarray (float)
        Bond stiffness

    d : ndarray (float)
        Bond damage (softening parameter). The value of d will range from 0
        to 1, where 0 indicates that the bond is still in the elastic range,
        and 1 represents a bond that has failed

    volume_correction_factors : ndarray (float)
        Array of volume correction factors (to improve spatial integration
        accuracy)

    lambda : ndarray (float)
        Array of surface correction factors (to correct the peridynamic
        surface effect). Also known as stiffness correction factors.

    stretch : ndarray (float)
        Bond stretch (dimensionless)

    Methods
    -------

    Notes
    -----
    * Code design
        - assign the same properties to all bonds
        - uniquely assign properties to individual bonds
